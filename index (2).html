<p>As you can see my key features defined that i am the kind of person that Good in Social Media because i love to share my daily routine on social media such as in Instagram story and of course in Twitter. I don't know why but i really like to share things that i do daily such as when i am hanging out with my friends or even when i am cooking something.  Besides, social media also gave me the benefit of knowledge for example lot of people are sharing something knowledgeable in social media these days.</p>
<p>Next, not going to lie that i am a really good listener, it is within myself that i don't like to see others feel sad or need someone to share anything.  That is why i would love to lend them my shoulder if that can make them feel better so why not? So, whenever my friends need someone to talk to they know that i am here for them.
<p>Last but not least, a sense of humour, i am very good at this trust me when i say this.  It is because i love to see everyone around me happy and laugh because you know by laughing it can reduce our daily life stress even it is last for a second but it is a necessary needs in life.
